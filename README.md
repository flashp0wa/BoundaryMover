# BoundaryMover
 The script can move boundaries from one group to another. It asks you at the end of the run, if you wish to delete the boundaries from the source group.
 You want to run the script like: 
 .\BoundaryMover.ps1 -SourceBoundaryGroup {name of the boundary group You move the boundaries from} -TargetBoundaryGroup {You got the idea I think}
